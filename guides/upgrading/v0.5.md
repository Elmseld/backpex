# Upgrading to v0.5

## Uploads: Change `consume_upload/4` to `consume_upload/5`

With 0.5 we pass the change / params to the `consume_upload/5` function defined in `Backpex.Fields.Upload`. So if you have an upload field that looks like this

```elixir
def fields do
    [
        ...
        images: %{
            consume_upload: &consume_upload/4,
        }

    ]
end

defp consume_upload(_socket, _item, %{path: path} = _meta, entry) do
    ...
end
```

change it to the following by adding the `change` parameter to the `consume_upload` function

```elixir
def fields do
    [
        ...
        images: %{
            consume_upload: &consume_upload/5,
        }

    ]
end

defp consume_upload(_socket, _item, _change, %{path: path} = _meta, entry) do
    ...
end
```
