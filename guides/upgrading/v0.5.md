# Upgrading to v0.5

## Uploads: Item in `consume_upload/4` now contains changes

Previously, we passed the item without its changes to the `consume_upload/4` callback function. With 0.5, we now pass the persisted item (with its changes) to the function.

## Resource actions now receives the data instead of the params

Previously, resource actions received the params from the form. With 0.5, resource actions now receive the data from the form. The data is a map that contains the casted and validated data from the form (received from `Ecto.Changeset.apply_changes/2`).
