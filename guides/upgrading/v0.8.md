# Upgrading to v0.8

## Adapter Pattern

With this version of Backpex we are starting to implement the adapter pattern for flexible datalayers.
Going forward you need to move adapter-specific configuration to the `adapter_config` options. Before:

```
  use Backpex.LiveResource,
    layout: {DemoWeb.Layouts, :admin},
    schema: Demo.User,
    repo: Demo.Repo,
    update_changeset: &Demo.User.changeset/3,
    create_changeset: &Demo.User.changeset/3,
    pubsub: Demo.PubSub,
    topic: "users",
    event_prefix: "user_"
```

After:

```
  use Backpex.LiveResource,
    adapter: Backpex.Adapters.Ecto,
    adapter_config: [
      schema: Demo.User,
      repo: Demo.Repo,
      update_changeset: &Demo.User.changeset/3,
      create_changeset: &Demo.User.changeset/3,
    ],
    layout: {DemoWeb.Layouts, :admin},
    pubsub: Demo.PubSub,
    topic: "users",
    event_prefix: "user_"
```

The `adapter` key is optional and defaults to `Backpex.Adapters.Ecto`.

In addition, all options of the LiveResource and the corresponding adapters are now validated at compile time.
